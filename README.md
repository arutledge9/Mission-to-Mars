# Mission-to-Mars

## Summary

I've been helping my friend Robin compile Mars images and facts using BeautifulSoup, Splinter, Flask, and Mongo to scrape facts and images from different websites, store them in a database, and then present them on a website we built together. Our final project together consisted of scraping Mars hemisphere images and titles, adding them to our site, and then making sure our site was mobile-friendly and using Bootstrap to add some additional components to the site to make it more friendly and "pop" a little more.
